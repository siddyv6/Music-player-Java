Music player [Java] (CW)

A music player created using java, which uses a SQL databse which is unfortunately tied to my university account therefore
the databse will only work on the universitys network or on there virtual machines.

The music player allows the users to see there music library, add/delete to songs, rate songs. 
There is a open a connection and statement to SQL Server database which then uses different methods containing different sql statements
which do different things in the database. Each methods has to have a try and catch in order to catch any exeception thrown back from the database.
